        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Butterbeer, from the Harry Potter book series, is described as foamy, spicy, and creamy.<br>
        The culinary team at Universal Orlando spent two years researching and developing the (closely guarded) recipe.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butterscotch topping</li>
            <li>1 to 2 teaspoons lemon juice</li>
            <li>6 (12 ounce) bottles cream soda</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Freeze 6 mugs or pint glasses until icy, at least 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, for whipped topping, beat together cream, cinnamon, and salt in a medium bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until stiff peaks form.</li>
            <li>Add butterscotch topping and lemon juice; beat again until soft peaks form. </li>
            <li>For each butter beer, pour 1 can cream soda into a mug; top with about 2 tablespoons whipped topping. Serve immediately.</li>    
        </ol>
